# cement polymerisation

Simulation of bone cement polymerisation using ABAQUS finite element software. 

Simulates exothermic polymerisation reaction solves for polymerisation fraction. Determines locations where polymerisation did not occur due to insufficient temperatures and calculates thermal damage to neighbouring bone.
