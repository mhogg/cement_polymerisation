# cement polymerisation

Simulation of bone cement polymerisation using ABAQUS finite element software. 

Simulates exothermic polymerisation reaction and solves for polymerisation fraction. Determines locations where polymerisation did not fully occur due to insufficient cement temperatures and calculates thermal damage to neighbouring bone.
